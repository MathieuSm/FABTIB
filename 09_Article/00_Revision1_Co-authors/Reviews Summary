Bettina
- More precision on author, university and hospital
- Verbal time to kep constant
- Add 's' to 3rd person in present !!!
- 'it allows to ...' add 'one' -> 'it allows one to ...'
- Avoid using 'subjects' or 'people' use 'individuals', 'patients', or 'participants'
- More precision on the matching -> are individuals excluded?
- First time abbreviation -> spell it
- HR-pQCT -> high resolution peripheral quantitative COMPUTED tomography
- Trabecular spacing -> trabecular separation
- '... than the other studies ...' -> add references
- Table 4: precise healthy + OI individuals (add labels)
- Avoid '&'
- Discussion:
    XCT vs XCTII: mention voxel size difference and other differences that can lead to different results
    Limitations: does distribution of OI influences data? i.e. Does the fact that mainly OI I is present has an influence? Especially for a weight bearing bone as the tibia, does having OI III patients which are mainly in wheelchair can have an influence?
- Add acknowledgments for Bettina founds
- Appendix 2: make the orientation axes bigger
- General english corrections: grammar and formulation

Mahdi
- English: grammar and formulation
- Figures: 
    Color and shape identifiers for plots
    Tibia projection for scanned region: use in vivo scout view
    Add figure to help understanding (fabric and simulation)
- Add results for full groups with free k and l
- Discussion:
    Mention limited to tibial scan
    Discuss threshold
    Trabecular bone no cortical evalutation
    More specific conclusion
