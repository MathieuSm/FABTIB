Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is the most common inherited form of bone fragility. This disease, also called "brittle bone disease", is characterized by impaired synthesis of type I collagen leading to fragile bones. In this study, 50 OI diagnosed people were compared to 120 healthy controls using second generation high resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT) scans of the distal tibia. Such scans are usually used in finite element analysis (FEA) for bone strength estimation and fracture risk assessment. The homogenized FE (hFE) scheme uses HR-pQCT bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and anisotropy information (fabric) and allows to assess bone strength within a reasonable computation time using fabric-elasticity relationships. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate fabric-elasticity relationships in OI compared to healthy controls. For this, six regions of interest (ROIs) were selected per individual in a common anatomical region. A first age \& gender matching allowed to perform a morphometric analysis and compare the samples with literature. Then, stiffness tensors of ROIs was computed by FEA and multiple linear regression was performed on the Zysset-Curnier orthotropic model to compare groups using 5 parameters. This fit was first executed using the complete data sets separately. Then, data were filtered according to a fixed threshold for a defined coefficient of variation (CV) assessing the ROI heterogeneity. A second fit was performed on these filtered data sets and a third fit was done on BV/TV \& fabric anisotropy (DA) matched data sets. This last matched data set was grouped to compare with literature \si{\micro}CT scans. Morphometric analysis shown results in agreement with literature, namely significant differences between groups for BV/TV, trabecular number (Tb N), trabecular spacing (Tb Sp), trabecular spacing standard deviation (Tb Sp SD) but no significant differences for trabecular thickness (Tb Th). The multiple linear regressions shown that OI stiffness range reach lower values than healthy controls and the fit tends of overestimate the stiffness at lower values. Filtering out high heterogeneous ROIs removes low stiffness ROIs and lead to similar fit quality for both OI and healthy group. The BV/TV \& DA matched data sets shown no significant differences between OI and healthy individuals and stiffness constants are lower at 61 \si{\micro}m resolution HR-pQCT scans than for higher resolution 36 \si{\micro}m \si{\micro}CT scans. Our main conclusions are that lower scan resolution lead to lower stiffness because the structure obtained is not as optimized as in reality. Finally, if trabecular bone is homogeneous enough ROIs inside ROI, there no reason to suppose different fabric-elasticity relationships between OI and healthy individual.
