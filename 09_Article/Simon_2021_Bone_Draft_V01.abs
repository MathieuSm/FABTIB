Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is an inherited form of bone fragility, also called "brittle bone disease". It is characterised by impaired synthesis of type I collagen, altered trabecular bone architecture and reduced bone mass. High resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a powerful method to investigate bone morphology of extremities including the weight-bearing distal tibia. The resulting 3D reconstructions can be used as a basis of micro-finite element (\si{\micro}FE) or homogenised finite element (hFE) models for bone strength estimation. The hFE scheme uses homogenized local bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and anisotropy information (fabric) to compute healthy bone strength within a reasonable computation time using fabric-elasticity relationships. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate fabric-elasticity relationships in OI trabecular bone compared to healthy controls.

^^IIn this study, the morphology of distal tibiae from 50 adults with OI were compared to 120 healthy controls using second generation HR-pQCT. Six cubic regions of interest (ROIs) were selected per individual in a common anatomical region. A first matching was performed by selecting similar individuals to obtain identical mean and median age and gender distribution in the OI and healthy control group. It allowed to perform a morphometric analysis and compare the outcome with literature. Then, stiffness tensors of ROIs were computed using hFEA and multiple linear regressions were performed on the Zysset-Curnier orthotropic model. The regressions allowed to compare the two groups using 5 parameters. An initial fit was performed on both the OI group and the healthy control group using all the ROIs extracted. Then, data were filtered according to a fixed threshold for a defined coefficient of variation (CV) assessing the ROI heterogeneity and second fits were performed on these filtered data sets. These full and filtered data were in turn compared with previous results from \si{\micro}CT reconstructions obtained in other anatomical locations. Finally, the ROIs of both group were matched according to their BV/TV and fabric anisotropy (DA). Fits were performed again using these matched data to detect statistical differences between the two groups.

^^ICompared to healthy controls, we found the OI samples to have significantly lower BV/TV and trabecular number (Tb.N.), significantly higher trabecular separation (Tb.Sp.) and trabecular spacing standard deviation (Tb.Sp.SD), but no differences in trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.). These results are in agreement to literature. The stiffness of ROIs from OI bone reached lower values compared to healthy controls and the multilinear fabric-elasticity fits tended to overestimate the stiffness in the lower range. The filtering of highly heterogeneous ROIs removed these low stiffness ROIs and lead to similar correlation coefficients for both OI and healthy groups. Finally, the BV/TV and DA matched data revealed no significant differences in fabric-elasticity parameters between OI and healthy individuals. Compared to previous studies, the stiffness constants from the 61 \si{\micro}m resolution HR-pQCT ROIs were lower than for the 36 \si{\micro}m resolution \si{\micro}CT ROIs.

^^IIn conclusion, despite the reduced regression parameters found for HR-pQCT images, the fabric-elasticity relationships between OI and healthy individuals are similar when the trabecular bone ROIs are sufficiently homogeneous to perform the mechanical analysis. Since highly heterogenous ROIs coincide with very low BV/TV, we expect them to play a minor role in hFE analysis of distal bone sections or parts.
