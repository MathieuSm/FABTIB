    abstract = {Motivated by the mechanical analysis of multiphase or damaged materials, a general approach relating fabric tensors characterizing microstructure to the fourth rank elasticity tensor is proposed. Using a Fourier expansion in spherical harmonics, the orientation distribution function of a positive, radially symmetric microstructural property is approximated by a scalar and a symmetric, traceless second rank tensor. Following this approximation, a general expression of the elastic free energy potential is derived from representation theorems for anisotropic scalar functions. Based on a homogeneity assumption for the elastic constitutive law with respect to the microstructural property, a particular elasticity model is developed that involves three independent constants beside the fabric tensors. Strict positive definiteness of the corresponding elasticity tensor is ensured under explicit conditions on the independent constants for arbitrary fabric tensors. {\textcopyright}1995.},

abstract = {Introduction: Micro finite element analysis ($\mu$FE) is a widely applied tool in biomedical research for assessing in vivo mechanical properties of bone at measurement sites, including the ultra-distal radius and tibia. A finite element approach (hFE) based on homogenized constitutive models for trabecular bone offers an attractive alternative for clinical use, as it is computationally less expensive than traditional $\mu$FE. The respective patient-specific models for in vivo bone strength estimation are usually based on standard clinical high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) measurements. They include a scan region of roughly 10 mm in height and are referred to as single-sections. It has been shown, that these small peripheral bone sections don't reliably cover the fracture line in Colles' fractures and therefore the weakest region at the radius. Recently introduced multiple section (multiple adjacent single-sections) measurements might improve the evaluation of bone strength, but little is known about the repeatability of hFE estimations in general, and especially for multiple section measurement protocols. Accordingly, the aim of the present work is to quantify repeatability of clinical in vivo bone strength measurement by hFE on multiple section HR-pQCT reconstructions at the distal radius and tibia. Methods: Nineteen healthy Swiss women (43.6y ± 17.8y) and twenty men (48.2y ± 19.4y) were examined with HR-pQCT at 61 $\mu$m isotropic voxel resolution. Each subject was first scanned three times using a double-section (336 slices) at the distal radius and then three times using a triple-section (504 slices) at the distal tibia. The multiple section HR-pQCT reconstructions were graded for motion artefacts and non-linear hFE models (radius and tibia) and linear $\mu$FE models (only radius) were generated for estimation of stiffness and ultimate load. Then in vivo repeatability errors were computed in terms of root mean square coefficients of variation (CV). Results: In vivo repeatability errors of non-linear hFE stiffness (S) and ultimate load (F) were significantly higher at the radius (S: 2.71% and F: 2.97%) compared to the tibia (S: 1.21%, F: 1.45%). Multiple section linear $\mu$FE at the radius resulted in substantially higher repeatability errors (S: 5.38% and F: 10.80%) compared to hFE. Discussion/conclusion: Repeatability errors of hFE outcomes based on multiple section measurements at the distal radius and tibia were generally lower compared to respective reported single-section $\mu$FE repeatability errors. Therefore, hFE is an attractive alternative to today's gold standard of $\mu$FE models and should especially be encouraged when analyzing multiple section measurements.},

abstract = {Introduction: The application of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to assess bone microarchitecture has grown rapidly since its introduction in 2005. As the use of HR-pQCT for clinical research continues to grow, there is an urgent need to form a consensus on imaging and analysis methodologies so that studies can be appropriately compared. In addition, with the recent introduction of the second-generation HrpQCT, which differs from the first-generation HR-pQCT in scan region, resolution, and morphological measurement techniques, there is a need for guidelines on appropriate reporting of results and considerations as the field adopts newer systems. Methods: A joint working group between the International Osteoporosis Foundation, American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, and European Calcified Tissue Society convened in person and by teleconference over several years to produce the guidelines and recommendations presented in this document. Results: An overview and discussion is provided for (1) standardized protocol for imaging distal radius and tibia sites using HR-pQCT, with the importance of quality control and operator training discussed; (2) standardized terminology and recommendations on reporting results; (3) factors influencing accuracy and precision error, with considerations for longitudinal and multi-center study designs; and finally (4) comparison between scanner generations and other high-resolution CT systems. Conclusion: This article addresses the need for standardization of HR-pQCT imaging techniques and terminology, provides guidance on interpretation and reporting of results, and discusses unresolved issues in the field.},

abstract = {Mechanical properties of human trabecular bone play an important role in age-related bone fragility and implant stability. Microfinite element (lFE) analysis allows computing the apparent elastic properties of trabecular bone for use in homogenized FE (hFE) analysis, but the results depend unfortunately on the type of applied boundary conditions (BCs). In this study, 167 human femoral trabecular cubic regions with a side length of 5.3mm were extracted from three proximal femora and analyzed using lFE analysis to compare systematically their stiffness with kinematic uniform BCs (KUBCs) and periodicity-compatible mixed uniform BCs (PMUBCs). The obtained elastic constants were then used in the volume fraction and fabric-based orthotropic Zysset-Curnier model to identify their respective model parameters. As expected, PMUBCs lead to more compliant apparent elastic properties than KUBCs, especially in shear. The differences in stiffness decreased with bone volume fraction and mean intercept length (MIL). Unlike KUBCs, PMUBCs were sensitive to heterogeneity of the biopsies. The Zysset-Curnier model fitted the apparent elastic constants successfully in both cases with adjusted coefficients of determination (r2adj) of 0.986 for KUBCs and 0.975 for PMUBCs. The proper use of these BCs for hFE analysis of whole bones will need to be investigated in future work.},

Samples too small to be representative appear stiffer under kinematic uniform BCs (KUBCs) than under periodicity-compatible mixed uniform BCs (PMUBCs). To avoid those effects, we propose to determine the effective properties of trabecular bone using an embedded configuration. Cubic samples of various sizes (2.63, 5.29, 7.96, 10.58 and 15.87 mm) were cropped from $\mu$CT scans of femoral heads and vertebral bodies. They were converted into $\mu$FE models and their stiffness tensor was established via six uniaxial and shear load cases. PMUBCs- and KUBCs-based tensors were determined for each sample. “In situ” stiffness tensors were also evaluated for the embedded configuration, i.e. when the loads were transmitted to the samples via a layer of trabecular bone. The Zysset–Curnier model accounting for bone volume fraction and fabric anisotropy was fitted to those stiffness tensors, and model parameters $\nu$0 (Poisson's ratio) E0 and $\mu$0 (elastic and shear moduli) were compared between sizes. BCs and sample size had little impact on $\nu$0. However, KUBCs- and PMUBCs-based E0 and $\mu$0, respectively, decreased and increased with growing size, though convergence was not reached even for our largest samples. Both BCs produced upper and lower bounds for the in situ values that were almost constant across samples dimensions, thus appearing as an approximation of the effective properties. PMUBCs seem also appropriate for mimicking the trabecular core, but they still underestimate its elastic properties (especially in shear) even for nearly orthotropic samples.},

On considère un milieu dans lequel la déformation plastique s'effectue par glissements suivant plusieurs familles de plans parallèles, ou plus généralement met en jeu simultanément plusieurs mécanismes. Un tel cas a déjà été envisagé par différents auteurs (Budiansky [1], Sanders [7], Koiter [4]), mais seulement dans l'hypothèse de mécanismes indépendants. Koiter a, dans une synthèse d'une grande élégance [4], étendu la théorie classique de la plasticité au cas oú il existe plusieurs mécanismes d'écoulement indépendants. La généralisation que nous envisageons ici concerne le cas de mécanismes d'écoulement non indépendants. Un glissement suivant une première direction, par exemple, influe sur la résistance au glissement suivant une autre direction. Nous établissons d'abord et discutons la forme des relations d'écoulement correspondant à ce cas. Nous montrons ensuite que ces relations plus générales conservent les mêmes propriétés que celles de Koiter, moyennant deux hypothèses complémentaires qui permettent de retrouver tous les théorèmes de la théorie du potentiel plastique.
A medium is considered in which plastic deformation is induced simultaneously by several mechanisms. Such a scheme has already been proposed by different authors, notably Koiter, but assuming only independent mechanisms. The generalization considered here is concerned with the case of non-independent mechanisms. First the flow relations are established and their form discussed. It is shown next, with the aid of two complementary hypotheses, that these more general relations retain the same properties as those of Koiter. In conclusion, it is shown that these two hypotheses permit the finding of all the classical theorems of the theory of the plastic potential, as well as the properties of waves and surfaces of discontinuity established before for the case of a simple plastic potential.

abstract = {As our population ages, more individuals suffer from osteoporosis. This disease leads to impaired trabecular architecture and increased fracture risk. It is essential to understand how morphological and mechanical properties of the cancellous bone are related. Morphology-elasticity relationships based on bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and fabric anisotropy explain up to 98% of the variation in elastic properties. Yet, other morphological variables such as individual trabeculae segmentation (ITS) and trabecular bone score (TBS) could improve the stiffness predictions. A total of 743 micro-computed tomography ($\mu$CT) reconstructions of cubic trabecular bone samples extracted from femur, radius, vertebrae, and iliac crest were analyzed. Their morphology was assessed via 25 variables and their stiffness tensor (CFE) was computed from six independent load cases using micro finite element ($\mu$FE) analyses. Variance inflation factors were calculated to evaluate collinearity between morphological variables and decide upon their inclusion in morphology-elasticity relationships. The statistically admissible morphological variables were included in a multiple linear regression model of the dependent variable CFE. The contribution of each independent variable was evaluated (ANOVA). Our results show that BV/TV is the best determinant of CFE(r2adj = 0.889), especially in combination with fabric anisotropy (r2adj = 0.968). Including the other independent predictors hardly affected the amount of variance explained by the model (r2adj = 0.975). Across all anatomical sites, BV/TV explained 87% of the variance of the bone elastic properties. Fabric anisotropy further described 10% of the bone stiffness, but the improvement in variance explanation by adding other independent factors was marginal (<1%). These findings confirm that BV/TV and fabric anisotropy are the best determinants of trabecular bone stiffness and show, against common belief, that other morphological variables do not bring any further contribution. These overall conclusions remain to be confirmed for specific bone diseases and postelastic properties.},

We hypothesized that patients with OI have altered bone microstructure and bone geometry. In this cross-sectional study we compared patients with type I OI to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. A total of 39 (13 men and 26 women) patients with OI, aged 53 (range, 21-77) years, and 39 controls, aged 53 (range, 21-77) years, were included in the study. Twenty-seven of the patients had been treated with bisphosphonates. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at the distal radius and distal tibia and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of total hip, femoral neck, trochanteric region, and the lumbar spine (L1-L4) were performed. The patients were shorter than the controls (159 ± 10 cm versus 170 ± 9 cm, p < 0.001), but had similar body weight. In OI, areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was 8% lower at the hip (p < 0.05) and 13% lower at the spine (p < 0.001) compared with controls. The trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) was 28% lower in radius (p < 0.001) and 38% lower in tibia (p < 0.001) in OI compared with controls. At radius, total bone area was 5% lower in OI than in controls (p < 0.05). In the tibia, cortical bone area was 18% lower in OI (p < 0.001). In both radius and tibia the number of trabeculae was lower in patients compared to the controls (35% and 38%, respectively, p < 0.001 at both sites). Furthermore, trabecular spacing was 55% higher in OI in both tibia and radius (p < 0.001 at both sites) when compared with controls. We conclude that patients with type I OI have lower aBMD, vBMD, bone area, and trabecular number when compared with healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

abstract = {Summary: Bone microarchitecture by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) was assessed in adult patients with mild, moderate, and severe osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The trabecular bone score (TBS), bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and dual X-ray and laser (DXL) at the calcaneus were likewise assessed in patients with OI. Trabecular microstructure and BMD in particular were severely altered in patients with OI. Introduction: OI is characterized by high fracture risk but not necessarily by low BMD. The main purpose of this study was to assess bone microarchitecture and BMD at different skeletal sites in different types of OI. Methods: HR-pQCT was performed in 30 patients with OI (mild OI-I, n = 18 (41.8 [34.7, 55.7] years) and moderate to severe OI-III-IV, n = 12 (47.6 [35.3, 58.4] years)) and 30 healthy age-matched controls. TBS, BMD by DXA at the lumbar spine and hip, as well as BMD by DXL at the calcaneus were likewise assessed in patients with OI only. Results: At the radius, significantly lower trabecular parameters including BV/TV (p = 0.01 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and trabecular number (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) as well as an increased inhomogeneity of the trabecular network (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) were observed in OI-I and OI-III-IV in comparison to the control group. Similar results for trabecular parameters were found at the tibia. Microstructural parameters were worse in OI-III-IV than in OI-I. No significant differences were found in cortical thickness and cortical porosity between the three subgroups at the radius. The cortical thickness of the tibia was thinner in OI-I (p < 0.001), but not OI-III-IV, when compared to controls. Conclusions: Trabecular BMD and trabecular bone microstructure in particular are severely altered in patients with clinical OI-I and OI-III-IV. Low TBS and DXL and their significant associations to HR-pQCT parameters of trabecular bone support this conclusion.},

Skeletal assessment included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), and bone turnover serum analyses. Bone microstructure of 21/29 OI patients was assessed and compared to 23 age- and sex-matched patients clinically classified EOOP but without mutations in the known disease genes as well as to 20 healthy controls. In the OI patients, we did not observe an age-dependent decrease in DXA Z-scores. HR-pQCT revealed a significant reduction in volumetric BMD and microstructural parameters in the distal radius and tibia in both the OI and EOOP cohorts compared to the healthy controls. When comparing the bone microstructure of OI patients with the EOOP cohort, significant differences were found in terms of bone geometry in the radius, while no significant changes were detected in all other HR-pQCT parameters at the radius and tibia. Taken together, adult mild OI patients demonstrate a predominantly high bone turnover trabecular bone loss syndrome that shows minor microstructural differences compared to EOOP without mutation detection.},
