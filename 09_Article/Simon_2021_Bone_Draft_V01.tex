\begin{abstract}
	Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is an inherited form of bone fragility, also called "brittle bone disease". It is characterised by impaired synthesis of type I collagen, altered trabecular bone architecture and reduced bone mass. High resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a powerful method to investigate bone morphology of extremities including the weight-bearing distal tibia. The resulting 3D reconstructions can be used as a basis of micro-finite element (\si{\micro}FE) or homogenised finite element (hFE) models for bone strength estimation. The hFE scheme uses homogenized local bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and anisotropy information (fabric) to compute healthy bone strength within a reasonable computation time using fabric-elasticity relationships. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate fabric-elasticity relationships in OI trabecular bone compared to healthy controls.
	
	In this study, the morphology of distal tibiae from 50 adults with OI were compared to 120 healthy controls using second generation HR-pQCT. Six cubic regions of interest (ROIs) were selected per individual in a common anatomical region. A first matching was performed by selecting similar individuals to obtain identical mean and median age and gender distribution in the OI and healthy control group. It allowed to perform a morphometric analysis and compare the outcome with literature. Then, stiffness tensors of ROIs were computed using hFEA and multiple linear regressions were performed on the Zysset-Curnier orthotropic model. The regressions allowed to compare the two groups using 5 parameters. An initial fit was performed on both the OI group and the healthy control group using all the ROIs extracted. Then, data were filtered according to a fixed threshold for a defined coefficient of variation (CV) assessing the ROI heterogeneity and second fits were performed on these filtered data sets. These full and filtered data were in turn compared with previous results from \si{\micro}CT reconstructions obtained in other anatomical locations. Finally, the ROIs of both group were matched according to their BV/TV and fabric anisotropy (DA). Fits were performed again using these matched data to detect statistical differences between the two groups.
	
	Compared to healthy controls, we found the OI samples to have significantly lower BV/TV and trabecular number (Tb.N.), significantly higher trabecular separation (Tb.Sp.) and trabecular spacing standard deviation (Tb.Sp.SD), but no differences in trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.). These results are in agreement to literature. The stiffness of ROIs from OI bone reached lower values compared to healthy controls and the multilinear fabric-elasticity fits tended to overestimate the stiffness in the lower range. The filtering of highly heterogeneous ROIs removed these low stiffness ROIs and lead to similar correlation coefficients for both OI and healthy groups. Finally, the BV/TV and DA matched data revealed no significant differences in fabric-elasticity parameters between OI and healthy individuals. Compared to previous studies, the stiffness constants from the 61 \si{\micro}m resolution HR-pQCT ROIs were lower than for the 36 \si{\micro}m resolution \si{\micro}CT ROIs.
	
	In conclusion, despite the reduced regression parameters found for HR-pQCT images, the fabric-elasticity relationships between OI and healthy individuals are similar when the trabecular bone ROIs are sufficiently homogeneous to perform the mechanical analysis. Since highly heterogenous ROIs coincide with very low BV/TV, we expect them to play a minor role in hFE analysis of distal bone sections or parts.

\section{Introduction}

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also commonly known as "brittle bone disease", is an inherited form of bone fragility \cite{Tournis2018}. OI prevalence is estimated at about  1/13,500 of births, less severe forms being not accounted in this estimation as they are recognized later in life \cite{Lindahl2015}. Therefore, OI is considered as a rare metabolic bone disorder. In most cases, OI is caused by mutations in genes encoding type I collagen (COL1A1 and COL1A2), leading to brittle and fragile bones \cite{LIM2017}, as well as deformed geometry and size in some cases. OI can be categorized according to disease severity \cite{Mortier2019} into:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Type I: mild
	\item Type II: perinatally lethal
	\item Type III: most severe surviving form
	\item Type IV: intermediate severity
\end{itemize}

Bone fragility in OI is complex and not totally understood, despite the investigations at different hierarchical levels. Multiple studies show that DXA areal bone mineral density (aBMD) tends to be lower in OI compared to healthy individuals \cite{Folkestad2012,Lindahl2015,Scheres2018}.  \citeauthor{Folkestad2012}\cite{Folkestad2012}, \citeauthor{Kocijan2015}\cite{Kocijan2015}, and \citeauthor{Rolvien2018}\cite{Rolvien2018} have shown that the microstructure is different as well, namely bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and trabecular number (Tb.N.) in OI bone is lower than for healthy controls. Trabecular separation (Tb.Sp.) and inhomogeneity (Tb.Sp.SD) are higher for individuals with OI but the trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.) is not significantly different. At the ECM level, a recent study showed that, in compression, OI bone tends to present higher modulus, ultimate stress and post-yield behavior than healthy bone, mostly affected by the higher degree of mineralization of OI bone \cite{Indermaur2021}.\\

High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) scans allow one to perform \textit{in vivo} assessment of cortical and trabecular architecture and volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) in the distal radius and distal tibia \cite{Boutroy2005}. Moreover, the image obtained from HR-pQCT can be used for finite element analysis (FEA) to predict mechanical properties \cite{Boutroy2008}. Homogenized finite element (hFE) is based on BV/TV and anisotropy information (fabric) from the HR-pQCT scan that can be used to assess bone strength within a reasonable computation time \cite{Pahr2009}. High correlations were found between patient-specific hFE and mechanical compression experiments of freshly frozen human samples at the distal radius \cite{Varga2011,AriasMoreno2019}. Thus, it could be legitimate to use hFE for OI patient's bone strength estimation and potentially fracture risk assessment. However, HR-pQCT-based FEA relies on fabric-elasticity relationships. Therefore, the present study aims to compare trabecular bone microstructure of healthy and OI bone samples and to investigate the hypothesis of similar fabric-elasticity relationships.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Participants}
The healthy group included a total of 120 patients from a previous reproducibility study performed at the University Department of osteoporosis in Bern \cite{Schenk2020}. The group was composed of 64 females and 56 males aged between 20 and 92 years old with a mean age of 32 $\pm$ 15 years. These subjects had not taken any medication known to affect bone metabolism nor presented with any prior osteoporosis fracture. The second group was scanned as part of the ASTEROID study at different locations in Canada, namely at the Shriners Hospital for Children-Canada. The study coordination was done by the McGill University in Montreal. This group was composed of 35 females and 15 males with confirmed diagnosis of OI Type I, III or IV. There were 35 patients diagnosed with OI type I, 2 with type III, and 13 with type IV. The participants of the OI group were aged between 19 and 69 years old with a mean age of 44 $\pm$ 14 years. 

\subsection{HR-pQCT}
HR-pQCT scans (XtremeCTII, SCANCO Medical, Brütisellen,
Switzerland) were performed at the distal tibia on all patients from both groups. Participants in the healthy group were scanned using an in-house protocol as described in \cite{Schenk2020}. Namely, the reference line was positioned at the proximal margin of the dense structure formed by the tibia plafond and three stacks were scanned proximal to this reference line, see Figure \ref{01_Healthy}. On the other hand, participants in the OI group were scanned using the manufacturer's standard protocol i.e. the reference line is placed at the subchondral endplate of the ankle joint and one stack was scanned at 22.5 mm proximal to the reference line (standard clinical section) \cite{Whittier2020}, see Figure \ref{01_OI}. The scanned region according to the two different protocol are shown side by side in Figure \ref{01_ClinicalSections}. For both the healthy and the OI groups, each stack consisted of 168 slices and a voxel resolution of 61 \si{\micro}m in the three principal directions. This led to a thickness of roughly 10.2 mm for each stack. Standardized scanning settings were used (voltage of 60 kVp, 900 μA, 100 ms integration time) for the healthy group as well as for the OI group. For the healthy group, motion artefacts of first, middle and last slice (i.e slices number 1, 252, and 504) were graded on a scale of 1 (no motion artefacts) to 5 (extreme motion artefacts), as proposed by \citeauthor{Pialat2012} \cite{Pialat2012}. The final grade of each scan was defined as the highest slice grade. For the OI group, as the scan consisted of one stack, only one grade was attributed using the same scale as for the control group. Scans were then processed independently of their quality grading. A summary of the scans grading is shown in Figure \ref{01_MotionArtefacts}.

\subsection{Image analysis}
The HR-pQCT scans were evaluated using the manufacturer's standard protocol. Briefly, an automatic contouring algorithm was applied to define the periosteal contour of the tibia (masking) and a threshold was applied for segmentation of cortical bone (450 mgHA/cm\textsuperscript{3}) and trabecular bone (320 mgHA/cm\textsuperscript{3}). Then, mask segmented images were used for further analysis.\\

In general, six cubic ROIs were selected at random position in each scan in a defined area. Each ROI had to contain trabecular bone, but no cortical bone. For the healthy group, the ROIs were selected in the more proximal stack uniquely (see Figure \ref{01_Healthy} stack number 3) to be at the same anatomical location as for the OI group. Then for both the healthy group and the OI group, the stack was divided into two halves and the ROIs were selected to have the centres of three ROIs in the proximal half and three in the distal half. For one individual diagnosed with OI type III it was not possible to extract any ROI as there was no enough trabecular bone. This led to 720 healthy ROIs from 120 individuals and 294 OI ROIs from 49 individuals.\\

The ROI was defined as a cube of 5.3 mm side length. This size was in agreement with the work of \citeauthor{Panyasantisuk2015}\cite{Panyasantisuk2015} and \citeauthor{Gross2013}\cite{Gross2013}, who performed similar analysis with femur \si{\micro}CT scans. It was determined by \citeauthor{Zysset1998}\cite{Zysset1998} and \citeauthor{Daszkiewicz2017}\cite{Daszkiewicz2017} to allow one to have a relative homogeneity of trabecular tissue within the ROI leading to accurate \si{\micro}FE results with a minimal computational cost.\\

After ROI cleaning, i.e. deletion of unconnected region of bone material, the morphological analysis of ROIs was performed using medtool (v4.5; Dr. Pahr Ingenieurs e.U., Pfaffstätten, Austria). The morphological parameters analyzed were: BV/TV, structural model index (SMI), trabecular number (Tb.N.), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp.), and the standard deviation of the trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp.SD). Moreover, ROI tissue bone mineral density (tBMD) and fabric was evaluated. The fabric tensor $\mathbf{M}$ was computed using mean intercept length (MIL) method \cite{Moreno2014}. It is a positive-definite second-order tensor built as shown in Equation \ref{Eq201} below:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{M} = \sum_{i=1}^{3}{m_i \mathbf{M}_i} = \sum_{i=1}^{3}{m_i \mathbf{m}_i \otimes \mathbf{m}_i}
	\label{Eq201}
\end{equation}

where $m_i$ are the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{M}_i$ are the dyadic product of the corresponding eigenvectors $\mathbf{m}_i$ \cite{Cowin1985,Harrigan1985}. The fabric tensor is independent of BV/TV and normalized with $tr(\mathbf{M}) = 3$. The fabric eigenvalues allow to compute the degree of anisotropy (DA) of the ROI by dividing the highest eigenvalue by the lowest one. Figure \ref{01_FabricExample} shows an example of a typical ROI with the visualization of its fabric tensor.\\

	\caption{Typical ROI with the visualization of its fabric tensor using MIL method. Eigenvectors of the fabric tensor define its orientation and eigenvalues set lengths of the ellipsoid radii. DA is the ratio between the highest and the lowest eigenvalue.}
	\label{01_FabricExample}
\end{figure}

A \si{\micro}FE mechanical analysis was performed using \textsc{ABAQUS 6.14}. In brief, each voxel of the cleaned ROI was converted to a fully integrated linear brick elements (C3D8) using a direct voxel conversion approach. Then, a stiffness $E$ of 10,000 MPa and a Poisson's ratio $\nu$ of 0.3 were assigned. The homogenization process consisted of 6 independent simulations of different load cases, 3 uni-axial and 3 simple shear cases, using kinematic uniform boundary conditions (KUBCs) \cite{Panyasantisuk2015}. Unlike periodicity-compatible mixed uniform boundary conditions (PMUBCs), KUBCs do not require one to rotate the ROI into fabric coordinate system. Such rotation would potentially decrease image quality. The homogenization process allowed to calculate the components of the stiffness tensor and to calibrate the parameters of the Zysset-Curnier fabric-elasticity model \cite{Zysset1995}. This model builds the fourth order stiffness tensor $\mathbb{S}$ using the BV/TV or $\rho$, fabric tensor $\mathbf{M}$, three elasticity parameters $\lambda_0$, $\lambda_0$', and $\mu_0$, and two exponents, $k$ and $l$, as shown in Equation \ref{Eq202}.\\

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		&\mathbb{S}(\rho,\mathbf{M}) &=& \quad\sum_{i=1}^{3} \lambda_{ii} \mathbf{M}_i \otimes \mathbf{M}_i \\ &&&+ \sum_{\substack{i,j=1\\i \neq j}}^{3} \lambda_{ij} \mathbf{M}_i \otimes \mathbf{M}_j \\ &&&+ \sum_{\substack{i,j=1\\i \neq j}}^{3} \mu_{ij} \mathbf{M}_i \overline{\underline{\otimes}} \mathbf{M}_j \\
		&\text{With} &\\
		&\qquad\lambda_{ii} &=& \quad(\lambda_0 + 2\mu_0)\rho^k m_i^{2l} \\
		&\qquad\lambda_{ij} &=& \quad\lambda_0' \rho^k m_i^{l} m_j^{l} \\
		&\qquad\mu_{ij} &=& \quad\mu_0 \rho^k m_i^{l} m_j^{l} \\
	\end{split}
	\label{Eq202}
\end{equation}

Where $\otimes$ and $\overline{\underline{\otimes}}$ are the dyadic and symmetric product of second order tensors, respectively. To express the stiffness tensor obtained from the homogenization process with the Zysset-Curnier model, it had to be transformed into the fabric coordinate system using a coordinates transformation formula (see Equation \ref{Eq203p}) and projected onto orthotropy, leading to 12 components. 

\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{S}_{ijkl}' = Q_{im}Q_{jn}Q_{ko}Q_{lp} \mathbb{S}_{mnop}
	\label{Eq203p}
\end{equation}

Where $\mathbb{S}'$ and $\mathbb{S}$ are the transformed and the original stiffness tensor respectively and $Q$ is the orthogonal matrix that maps the original coordinate system into the new one (fabric). The Zysset-Curnier model is built with the assumption of orthotropy and homogeneity. However, the trabecular structure is not perfectly homogeneous. In order to assess the ROI heterogeneity, a coefficient of variation (CV) is computed according to \citeauthor{Panyasantisuk2015}\cite{Panyasantisuk2015}: the ROI is divided into eight identical sub-cubes and BV/TV is computed for each of them. The CV is defined as the ratio between the standard deviation of these BV/TV and the mean value (Equation \ref{Eq203}).

\begin{equation}
	CV = \frac{SD(BV/TV_{subcubes})}{mean(BV/TV_{subcubes})}
	\label{Eq203}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Statistics}
The analyzed morphological parameters (BV/TV, Tb.N., Tb.Th., Tb.Sp., and Tb.Sp.SD, SMI, DA, and CV) were compared between the healthy and the OI groups. As the groups do not have similar distributions of age and sex, a matching was performed by selecting similar individuals leading to identical mean and median age as well as identical gender distribution. For each parameter, the median value between the six ROIs from the same individual was computed. The median was preferred over the mean because it is less influenced by outliers. Normality of the distribution was assessed with QQ plot and Shapiro-Wilk test. CV had to be log-transformed to meet normal distribution assumption. Then, equal variances was assessed using Bartlett test or Brown-Forsythe test according to the normality distribution of the data. According to the normality and equal variances assumptions, t-test, Mann-Whitney test or a non-parametric permutation test was performed. The general significance level was set to 95\% for all tests. Confidence intervals was computed for t-tested variables to confirm a difference in both groups means. As Mann-Whitney tests are performed on the median, only the corresponding p-value is presented. Finally, non-parametric permutation tests are less powerful but give an empirical 95\% exclusion range and a p-value. If the difference in means belong to this exclusion range, it can be stated that group means are different with 95\% certainty.

\subsection{Linear Regression}
The orthotropic stiffness tensors obtained after transformation onto fabric coordinate system were then used to perform a multiple linear regression with the Zysset-Curnier model. Standard linear models assume independent and identically distributed (iid) variables. As this assumption was violated by the fact that six ROIs were analyzed per individual, a linear mixed-effect model was preferred. This last model, shown in Equation \ref{Eq204} in Laird-Ware form \cite{Laird1982}, considered the non-independence of ROIs from the same individual. A more detailed form of this model is presented in Appendix \ref{A1}.

\begin{equation}
	y = X \beta + Z \delta + \epsilon \quad \text{with} \quad y = \ln(S_{rc})
	\label{Eq204}
\end{equation}

Where $S_{rc}$ is the $r$th row and $c$th column of the non-zero element of the orthotropic stiffness tensor $\mathbb{S}$ in Mandel notation \cite{MANDEL1965}, $X$ is a $12n$x$p$ design matrix containing the the BV/TV and fabric info of the $n$ ROIs and $\beta$ is a $p$x1 vector of fixed effects containing model parameters. $Z$ is a $12n$x$f$ design matrix which contains data with individual dependence and $\delta$ is a $f$x1 vector composed of random factors. Finally, $\epsilon$ is a $12n$x1 vector containing the regression residuals. As $k$ and $l$ are exponents, the regression was performed on the log space.\\

The linear regression was performed on both group (heal\-thy and OI) separately. To improve the fit quality, the data sets were filtered. The aim here was to filter out ROIs violating the assumption of homogeneity. Therefore, analogously to the work of \citeauthor{Panyasantisuk2015}\cite{Panyasantisuk2015}, a fixed threshold for the CV was used. To simplify comparison, we used the same value 0.263 as exclusion criterion \cite{Panyasantisuk2015}. Then, the relation between BV/TV and CV was assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. To compare the stiffness constants ($\lambda_0$, $\lambda_0'$, and $\mu_0$) between the groups, regression must be performed on identical value ranges. Therefore, a matching was performed for BV/TV and DA to find corresponding control ROIs for each OI in the filtered groups. Best correspondences were kept and duplicates were dropped. Finally, as the regression was performed in the log space, slight differences in the exponents ($k$ and $l$) would lead to important variation of the stiffness constants ($\lambda_0$, $\lambda_0'$, and $\mu_0$) so it was necessary to use identical exponents  for both groups, weighting identically BV/TV and DA between regressions. The exponents were determined by grouping healthy and OI for regression. Then a modified system was used to perform the fit on separated groups, see Appendix \ref{A1}, Equation \ref{EqA11}.\\

Another modification of the model was to add a regressor for the group variable (healthy or OI), i.e. add a column to the design matrix $X$ and a row to the parameter vector $\beta$. This modified model is compared to the original by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using the fixed-effects only to determine the statistical significance of the group. Implementation of this modification was performed according to \cite{Fox2016}. A similar mixed-effect model was used to analyze the relation between tBMD and BV/TV and the significance of the group, see Appendix \ref{A1} Equation \ref{EqA14}. The model used the BV/TV and the group (healthy or OI) as fixed variables and the individual as random variable. Moreover, to test the hypothesis of no interaction between the BV/TV and the group, i.e. the group has no significant influence on the tBMD versus BV/TV slope, the model was modified to add the interaction regressor (BV/TV x Group). The detailed linear systems for each model discussed here are available in Appendix \ref{A1} and a summary of the data sets used for the different methods is shown in Table \ref{Table1}.\\

The regression was performed using the \textsc{statsmodels} package from \textsc{Python 3.6}. Regression quality for the tBMD analysis was assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient ($R^2$) and the standard error of the estimate (SE). Regression on Zysset-Curnier model was assessed using the adjusted Pearson correlation coefficient squared ($R^2_{adj}$) and relative error between the orthotropic observed and the predicted tensor using norm of fourth-order tensors (NE), see Equation \ref{Eq205} and \ref{Eq206}. 

\begin{equation}
	R^2_{adj} = 1 - \frac{RSS}{TSS} \frac{(12n-1)}{(12n - p - 1)}
	\label{Eq205}
\end{equation}

Where RSS is the residual sum of squares and TSS is the total sum of squares i.e. sum of the square of the observations y. $n$ is the number of ROIs and $p$ the number of parameters.

\begin{equation}
	\text{NE} = \sqrt{\frac{(\mathbb{S}_o - \mathbb{S}_p) :: (\mathbb{S}_o - \mathbb{S}_p)}{\mathbb{S}_o :: \mathbb{S}_o}}
	\label{Eq206}
\end{equation}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Morphological Analysis}
The results of morphological analysis are summarized in Table \ref{Table2}. In the present study, the individual matching allowed us to have similar group distributions with 17 females and 11 males in each group. The mean age of matched healthy is 41 $\pm$ 14 and 41 $\pm$ 15 for the matched OI. BV/TV of healthy individuals is higher than BV/TV of OI group with a 95\% CI of [0.016, 0.101] and p value <0.01. Similarly, trabecular number is higher in the matched healthy group with a 95\% CI of [0.099, 0.285] and a corresponding p value <0.001. The trabecular thickness do not show significant differences between groups with a p value of 0.2. On the other hand, trabecular separation is higher in matched OI group than in healthy individuals with a p value of 0.01 and an exclusion range of ($-\infty$ ,-0.384] $\cup$ [0.421,$\infty$). Trabecular separation SD present to be higher in OI patients than in matched healthy with a p value of 0.02 and an exclusion range of ($-\infty$ ,-0.232] $\cup$ [0.251,$\infty$). SMI as well as degree of anisotropy are higher for matched OI than for healthy people with p values <0.001 and of 0.02, respectively. Finally, the log transformation of coefficient of variation gives the stronger difference in means with a p value <0.0001 and a 95\% CI of [−0.757, −0.333].\\

In Table \ref{Table2}, absolute values and p values of test statistics are compared with literature. Regarding age, the present population is slightly younger than in the other studies \cite{Folkestad2012,Kocijan2015,Rolvien2018} but stay in a similar range. In a general way p values of the three other studies (\citeauthor{Folkestad2012}\cite{Folkestad2012}, \citeauthor{Kocijan2015}\cite{Kocijan2015}, and \citeauthor{Rolvien2018}\cite{Rolvien2018}) show significant differences for BV/TV, Tb.N., Tb.Sp., and Tb.Sp.SD and non significant differences for Tb.Th. Absolute values of BV/TV, TB.Th., Tb.Sp., and Tb.Sp.SD are higher in the present study compared to literature. On the other hand, Tb.N. appears to be higher in the other studies \cite{Folkestad2012,Kocijan2015,Rolvien2018} than in the present one.

\subsection{Linear Regression with Original Data Sets}
Figure \ref{02_GeneralRegression} shows the results of the regression analysis for the complete data sets of each group separately. The x axis represent the values of observed tensors from \si{\micro}FE simulations. The y axis is the predicted values using the Zysset-Curnier model and the parameters obtained after performing the regression with linear mixed-effect model. The fitted line is represented by the dashed line, indicating the theoretical perfect correlation. $\lambda_{ii}$ stands for the diagonal terms of normal components of $\mathbb{S}$ in Mandel notation\cite{MANDEL1965}, $\lambda_{ij}$ for the off-diagonal terms of normal components, and $\mu_{ij}$ for the shear components. For the healthy group, see Figure \ref{02_Healthy}, the fit is performed on 720 ROIs leading to 8640 points. The $R^2_{adj}$ is slightly above 0.95 and the NE is of 18\% $\pm$ 10\%. The regression analysis for the OI group led to 3528 points, a $R^2_{adj}$ close to 0.85 and a NE of 62\% $\pm$ 233\%. It can be noticed that, as the values of the observed tensor decreases, points tends to be further apart of the diagonal (dashed line). Moreover, the points coming from the tensors with lowest values are only above the diagonal. One last observation which should be noted is the range covered by the observed tensors. The range of the OI group is wider than the healthy group and ROIs with lower BV/TV present further low stiffness values. The values of these ROIs tensors components tends to be overestimated by the fit.\\

\subsection{Filtering}
The CV in relation to BV/TV is shown in Figure \ref{02_CV_BVTV}. The OI data reach higher values of CV and stay at lower values of BV/TV than healthy data. Generally, the CV tends to increase with decreasing BV/TV. The Spearman coefficient is shown above the plot as value [95\% CI]. Its value is negative and strictly different from zero. Finally, the CV threshold value used to filter the data is represented by the dashed line. It can be observed that a relatively important part of OI data will be filtered out. On the other hand, relatively few healthy data will be removed by the filtering. Examples of extreme ROIs in terms of CV and BV/TV are shown in Appendix \ref{A2}.\\

	\label{02_CV_BVTV}
\end{figure}

The regression results of the filtered data are presented in Figure \ref{04_FilteredRegression}. After filtering, the healthy group was reduced to 119 individuals and 603 ROIs. This led to 7236 points for the regression. Results show similar values to the complete data set, namely a $R^2_{adj}$ close to 0.95 and a NE of 16\% $\pm$ 8\%, see Figure \ref{04_Healthy}. The OI group lost more individuals after filtering leading to 38 people and 115 ROIs. Regression is performed on 1380 points then. Figure \ref{04_OI} presents results with a $R^2_{adj}$ rounded to 0.95 and a NE of 17\% $\pm$ 8\%.\\

\subsection{BV/TV and DA Matching}
Regression results after BV/TV and DA ROI matching are shown in Table \ref{Table3}. The columns show which data set was used, the fives parameters of the Zysset-Curnier model and the assessment of fit quality. Grouping healthy and OI data together for regression lead to a $k$ of 1.91 and a $l$ of 0.95. Regression result shows a $R^2_{adj}$ of 0.94 and a NE of 18\% $\pm$ 9\%. Second and last rows show regression results using separated data sets and imposing the exponents $k$ and $l$. OI values are higher than healthy one. The increase is of 15\%, 1\%, and 2\% for $\lambda_0$, $\lambda_0'$, and $\mu_0$, respectively. The ANCOVA performed to quantify the group statistical significance shows a p value of 0.7.\\

The analysis of tBMD in relation to BV/TV is shown in Figure \ref{02_tBMD}. The t-test performed on the tBMD distributions led to a p-value <0.0001 and a 95\% CI of [-35,-13]. The linear regression performed using the linear mixed-effects model without BV/TV and group interaction provided a slope of 223 [153,292] (value [95\% CI]). The intercept was 534 [518,550] and the group variable led to a value of 14 [7,20]. The prediction using the fixed effects only led to a $R^2$ of 0.23 and a SE of 33. Then, using the linear mixed-effect model with the interaction regressor (BV/TV x Group), this added variable presented a value of 3 [-66,72] and a p-value of 0.94.

\section{Discussion}
Osteogenesis imperfecta is an inherited form of bone fra\-gi\-li\-ty with a severity going from mild to perinatally lethal. This study aim to confirm that fabric-elasticity relationships in OI trabecular bone are similar than in healthy conditions, encouraging the use of HR-pQCT scans for fracture risk assessment. To do this, the study included two groups of participants composed of 120 healthy control and 50 OI diagnosed patients respectively.\\

The age of matched individuals lies in the spectrum of the others studies \cite{Folkestad2012,Kocijan2015,Rolvien2018} which allow one to compare the morphological values. The main explanation for differences between the absolute values of the present study compared to the others lies in the imaging system. \citeauthor{Folkestad2012}\cite{Folkestad2012}, \citeauthor{Kocijan2015}\cite{Kocijan2015}, and \citeauthor{Rolvien2018}\cite{Rolvien2018} have performed first generation Xtreme CT scans with a voxel size of 82 \si{\micro}m and the present study used a second generation scanner, XCTII, with a voxel size of 61 \si{\micro}m. The work from \citeauthor{Agarwal2016}\cite{Agarwal2016} investigated differences between the two scanner types. They showed that BV/TV, Tb.Th., and Tb.Sp. is higher in second generation Xtreme CT and, on the other hand, Tb.N. is higher in first generation Xtreme CT. These results give confidence to the observed values. Another bias is introduced by the fact that the present study analyses the median values of six cubic ROIs with 5.3 mm side length. This conditions the Tb.N. and Tb.Sp. as they depend on the ROI size. Moreover, conditions imposed for ROI random selection can lead to further biased values, especially for OI patients, as it can not be empty of trabecular bone. The CV presenting the stronger significant difference between groups even given the low sample size show that heterogeneity is a main difference in OI patients compared to healthy individuals. Finally, the significant differences observed in BV/TV and DA even with age and gender matched individuals justify the choice of a variable matching for fabric-elasticity relationships analysis.\\

Regression performed on original data sets shows $R^2_{adj}$ and NE in the expected range for the healthy group. Components of the stiffness tensors are distributed to both sides of the diagonal. On the other hand, regression of the OI data set presents lower $R^2_{adj}$ than such fit reach usually. The important value of NE and its standard deviation shows that the fitted stiffness can deviate significantly from the observation. These differences come from the ROIs presenting a low stiffness. It can be seen on the regression plot (Figure \ref{02_OI}) that when the stiffness term decreases lower than $10^0$ MPa, the fit tends to overestimate the stiffness. This is due to the fact that ROI stiffness is highly impacted by BV/TV. Some low BV/TV ROIs do not have every side of the cube connected by bone leading to extremely low terms in the stiffness tensor, see Appendix \ref{A2}. Trying to homogenize such ROI can lead to error of multiple order of magnitude, as observed on the plot. Therefore, a filtering is indispensable to assess and compare fabric-elasticity relationships, as done by \citeauthor{Panyasantisuk2015} \cite{Panyasantisuk2015}. An alternative of CV filtering could be to compute the area ratio filled by bone on each of the six faces of the ROI to assess the ROI heterogeneity.\\

Figure \ref{02_CV_BVTV} presenting the CV in relation to BV/TV shows that there is a tendency of CV to increase with a decreasing BV/TV. Effectively, if the quantity of material inside the ROI decreases, the distribution homogeneity of this mass is more sensitive and therefore can quickly becomes highly heterogeneous. A simple assumption about this relation is that it could be monotonic. Pearson's correlation coefficient being strictly negative confirms a negative monotonic relation. As some higher BV/TV ROIs still present high CV, imposing a fixed threshold make sense for subsequent homogenization. However, the value of this threshold actually results from an optimization process in the study of \citeauthor{Panyasantisuk2015}\cite{Panyasantisuk2015} and could be subject to more investigations.\\

The fits performed on filtered data sets present direct effect of filtering. For the healthy group (N=603), the relatively small decrease of $R^2_{adj}$ (0.5\%) is negligible. On the other hand, NE presents an improved value decreasing by 2\%. These results are due to the filtering of points further away from the diagonal (better NE) and some points close to the diagonal leading to a smaller number of points ($R^2_{adj}$). For the OI group, filtering leads to a important improvement in the fit. Results become similar to the healthy group in terms of $R^2_{adj}$, NE, and the range of stiffness values. These results give confidence to the filtering procedure and are a first step to the hypothesis of there being no difference in fabric-elasticity relationships between healthy and OI trabecular bone.\\

After BV/TV and DA matching, grouping the data sets together led to similar $R^2_{adj}$ and NE as for individual filtered data sets. This allows one to give values for $k$ and $l$ for the tibia at a spatial resolution of 61 \si{\micro}m. Imposing these values to perform the fit on individual matched data sets allows us to highlight differences, if any, between healthy and OI trabecular bone. The relatively low differences for $\lambda_0'$ and $\mu_0$ once again provide arguments for similar relationships between the two groups. For $\lambda_0$, this relative difference being higher could rise some doubts about this similarity, but 95\% CI intervals still show a common range. Moreover, ANCOVA performed comparing the original formulation and the one with addition of a regressor for the group shown a p value far above the 5\% significance level. With this statistical non-significance of the group and low relative differences in the computed stiffness constants, it can be stated that: if trabecular bone is homogeneous enough, there is no reason to suppose differences in fabric-elasticity relationships between healthy and OI trabecular bone. In FEA simulations, it is not possible to exclude part of the mesh because of high heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the error created by such ROIs are negligible as this concerns ROIs with extremely low stiffness leading to a minor impact on the full model.\\

Imposing $k$ and $l$ allows one to estimate the effect of different image resolutions.  \citeauthor{Panyasantisuk2015}\cite{Panyasantisuk2015} and \citeauthor{Gross2013}\cite{Gross2013} both used femur scans with 18 \si{\micro}m spatial resolution and coarsened it to 36 \si{\micro}m. \citeauthor{Gross2013}\cite{Gross2013} shown that different anatomical locations lead to only slight differences. Comparing regression of filtered data set of \citeauthor{Panyasantisuk2015}\cite{Panyasantisuk2015} with the present study, the lower stiffness constants observed can be explained partially by the higher DA range and by the coarser resolution. Differences of $R^2_{adj}$ and NE come from the imposition of $k$ and $l$ to a different value than the optimal ones. Then, comparing regression results of \citeauthor{Panyasantisuk2015}\cite{Panyasantisuk2015}, \citeauthor{Gross2013}\cite{Gross2013}, and the present study, BV/TV ranges stay overlapped. As for filtered data sets, DA is higher in the present study and the stiffness constants remain lower than for the two other studies. Here, differences in DA can mainly be explained by the different anatomical location and differences in stiffness constants by resolution. The distal tibia, unlike the proximal femur, is mainly loaded in one direction which explain this increase of DA. Lower stiffness constants are obtained because the coarser structure resulting from XCTII can not be as optimized as the fine detailed structure obtained by \si{\micro}CT. Effectively, the architecture resulting from \si{\micro}CT scans can reproduce the optimized morphology of trabecular bone with a high fidelity. By decreasing the scan spatial resolution, the scanned structure becomes more bulky. Performing a fit on this less optimized structure lead to the observed lower stiffness constants. Finally, the comparison between $R^2_{adj}$ and NE of current study without imposing $k$ and $l$ and the ones of \citeauthor{Panyasantisuk2015}\cite{Panyasantisuk2015} and  \citeauthor{Gross2013}\cite{Gross2013} shows that lower spatial resolution leads to lower fit quality. Nevertheless, $l$ stands in the same range as for the two other studies meaning the relative weight of DA remains constant. On the other hand, the higher $k$ highlight an increased relative weight of BV/TV.\\

The analysis of tBMD gives interesting outputs as well. Although BV/TV and DA are in the same range because of the matching, the t-test reveal a higher tBMD in OI trabecular bone than in healthy condition with 95\% certainty and a very high significance level. The coefficients obtained from the linear mixed-effects model show that there is a relation between tBMD and BV/TV as zero is not included in the slope CI. This result can have different origins. From a biological point of view, the remodeling process leads to a mineralization gradient from the core of the trabecula to the outer surface. As trabecular thickness decreases with BV/TV, this means that with a lower BV/TV the core of trabeculae could be less mineralized. The second explanation for this slope comes from the scanning. Effectively, during scanning a phenomenon called partial volume effect occurs and its impact decreases with an increasing BV/TV. Nevertheless, the former (biological) explanation is expect to have a less significant impact than the latter (scanning). Regarding the other coefficients of the linear regression, the CI of group variable exclude zero as well leading to the conclusion that we have 95\% certainty that the intercept is different depending on the group. This could be explained by the bisphosphonate treatment that OI patients receive. Effectively, bisphosphonate is aimed to freeze the remodeling process which lead to higher mineralization of the bone. According to the results of \citeauthor{Indermaur2021}\cite{Indermaur2021} these findings suggest to add a correction accounting for the tBMD in FE simulations to catch the higher modulus, ultimate stress and post-yield behavior of OI bone compared to healthy bone at the ECM level. Regarding the interaction between BV/TV and the group, the p-value obtained show a high non-significance meaning that the slopes of both OI and healthy groups are the same. This could be visualized in Figure \ref{02_tBMD} where the fitted lines are obtained using the fixed effects of the model and the group variable if fixed. In this plot, performed with the interaction term (BV/TV x Group) the fitted lines appear to be quasi-parallel.

The main limitations of this study are the definition of "homogeneous enough" and the fact that it is limited to tibiae XCTII scans. Moreover, having only one patient with OI type III where we could extract ROIs does not allows to do statistics. Effectively as those patients are in wheelchair, it could be interesting to analyze the impact of this condition on the weight bearing tibia. The ROI homogeneity has an important impact on the analysis quality. As proposed earlier, ROI homogeneity could be assessed in another way to be able to propose a more precise ROI filtering for fitting. More investigations could be performed to improve the model for highly heterogeneous ROIs, but as it concerns mainly ROI with low stiffness the impact on FEA models can be negligible. Similar study could be performed using XCTII radii scans to confirm the low differences between anatomical locations for coarser resolution. Another limitation is that the scans were performed on different devices which were not cross-calibrated. However, as they are the same model, it is expected to have a minor impact.\\

In conclusions, the sample analyzed in the this study have similar morphology to data reported in the literature. We find no differences in fabric-elasticity relationships between healthy and OI trabecular bone if the ROI is homogeneous enough. \citeauthor{Indermaur2021}\cite{Indermaur2021} shown that compressive behavior of OI bone tissue is similar to healthy control. If tensile and shearing behaviors agree, fabric-strength relationships will hold too. Therefore, OI trabecular bone can explain part of the bone fragility by the decrease in BV/TV and loss of homogeneity in its trabecular organization.

\section{Linear Models}\label{A1}

The standard linear model has the form:

\begin{equation}
	\ln(S_{rc}) = X \beta + \epsilon
\end{equation}

Where $\epsilon$ is the vector of residuals. For one ROI, the system take the following form:

\begin{equation}
	\ln
	\begin{pmatrix}
		S_{11} \\
		S_{12} \\
		S_{13} \\
		S_{21} \\
		S_{22} \\
		S_{23} \\
		S_{31} \\
		S_{32} \\
		S_{33} \\
		S_{44} \\
		S_{55} \\
		S_{66} \\
	\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
		1 & 0 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1^2) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1 m_2) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1 m_3) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2 m_1) \\
		1 & 0 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2^2) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2 m_3) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3 m_1) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3 m_2) \\
		1 & 0 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3^2) \\
		0 & 0 & 1 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2 m_3) \\
		0 & 0 & 1 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3 m_1) \\
		0 & 0 & 1 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1 m_2) \\
	\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
		\ln(\lambda^{*}) \\
		\ln(\lambda_0') \\
		\ln(\mu_0) \\
		k \\
		l \\
	\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}
		\epsilon_{1} \\
		\epsilon_{2} \\
		\epsilon_{3} \\
		\epsilon_{4} \\
		\epsilon_{5} \\
		\epsilon_{6} \\
		\epsilon_{7} \\
		\epsilon_{8} \\
		\epsilon_{9} \\
		\epsilon_{10} \\
		\epsilon_{11} \\
		\epsilon_{12} \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

Where $\lambda^{*} = \lambda_0 + 2\mu_0$. Then, the mixed-effect model, which handles multiple measurement on the same individual, has the following general form:

\begin{equation}
	\ln(S_{rc}) = X \beta + Z \delta + \epsilon
\end{equation}

Where $Z$ is a design matrix composed of the observations which are correlated on the same individual and, in general, is a subset of $X$. In the present case, the stiffness variables ($\lambda_0$, $\lambda_0'$, and $\mu_0$) can vary between individuals but the hypothesis is that they all vary by an identical factor. Therefore, the design matrix $Z$ is composed of the addition of the three first columns of $X$ and the system for one ROI takes the following form:\\

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	\ln
	\begin{pmatrix}
		S_{11} \\
		S_{12} \\
		S_{13} \\
		S_{21} \\
		S_{22} \\
		S_{23} \\
		S_{31} \\
		S_{32} \\
		S_{33} \\
		S_{44} \\
		S_{55} \\
		S_{66} \\
	\end{pmatrix} & = \begin{pmatrix}
		1 & 0 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1^2) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1 m_2) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1 m_3) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2 m_1) \\
		1 & 0 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2^2) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2 m_3) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3 m_1) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3 m_2) \\
		1 & 0 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3^2) \\
		0 & 0 & 1 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2 m_3) \\
		0 & 0 & 1 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3 m_1) \\
		0 & 0 & 1 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1 m_2) \\
	\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
		\ln(\lambda^{*}) \\
		\ln(\lambda_0') \\
		\ln(\mu_0) \\
		k \\
		l \\
	\end{pmatrix}\\ & + \begin{pmatrix}
		1 \\
		1 \\
		1 \\
		1 \\
		1 \\
		1 \\
		1 \\
		1 \\
		1 \\
		1 \\
		1 \\
		1 \\
	\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
	\delta \\
	\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}
		\epsilon_{1} \\
		\epsilon_{2} \\
		\epsilon_{3} \\
		\epsilon_{4} \\
		\epsilon_{5} \\
		\epsilon_{6} \\
		\epsilon_{7} \\
		\epsilon_{8} \\
		\epsilon_{9} \\
		\epsilon_{10} \\
		\epsilon_{11} \\
		\epsilon_{12} \\
	\end{pmatrix}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

As the linear regression is performed in the log space, it is necessary to impose the exponent $k$ and $l$ in order to compare the stiffness values between groups. The system is then modified as follow:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\ln
		\begin{pmatrix}
			S_{11} \\
			S_{12} \\
			S_{13} \\
			S_{21} \\
			S_{22} \\
			S_{23} \\
			S_{31} \\
			S_{32} \\
			S_{33} \\
			S_{44} \\
			S_{55} \\
			S_{66} \\
		\end{pmatrix} - & \begin{pmatrix}
			\ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1^2) \\
			\ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1 m_2) \\
			\ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1 m_3) \\
			\ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2 m_1) \\
			\ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2^2) \\
			\ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2 m_3) \\
			\ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3 m_1) \\
			\ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3 m_2) \\
			\ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3^2) \\
			\ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2 m_3) \\
			\ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3 m_1) \\
			\ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1 m_2) \\
		\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
			k \\
			l \\
		\end{pmatrix} = \\ & \begin{pmatrix}
			1 & 0 & 0 \\
			0 & 1 & 0 \\
			0 & 1 & 0 \\
			0 & 1 & 0 \\
			1 & 0 & 0 \\
			0 & 1 & 0 \\
			0 & 1 & 0 \\
			0 & 1 & 0 \\
			1 & 0 & 0 \\
			0 & 0 & 1 \\
			0 & 0 & 1 \\
			0 & 0 & 1 \\
		\end{pmatrix} \ln\begin{pmatrix}
			\lambda^{*} \\
			\lambda_0' \\
			\mu_0 \\
		\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}
			\epsilon_{1} \\
			\epsilon_{2} \\
			\epsilon_{3} \\
			\epsilon_{4} \\
			\epsilon_{5} \\
			\epsilon_{6} \\
			\epsilon_{7} \\
			\epsilon_{8} \\
			\epsilon_{9} \\
			\epsilon_{10} \\
			\epsilon_{11} \\
			\epsilon_{12} \\
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{split}
	\label{EqA11}
\end{equation}

Finally, a modification of the model is to add a regressor for the group variable. Using a grouped data set (healthy and OI), it allows to determine if the group is statistically significant using ANCOVA. In such case the system is written under the form:\\

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\ln
		\begin{pmatrix}
			S_{11} \\
			S_{12} \\
			S_{13} \\
			S_{21} \\
			S_{22} \\
			S_{23} \\
			S_{31} \\
			S_{32} \\
			S_{33} \\
			S_{44} \\
			S_{55} \\
			S_{66} \\
		\end{pmatrix} = &\begin{pmatrix}
			1 & 0 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1^2) & S_g \\
			0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1 m_2) & S_g \\
			0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1 m_3) & S_g \\
			0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2 m_1) & S_g \\
			1 & 0 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2^2) & S_g \\
			0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2 m_3) & S_g \\
			0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3 m_1) & S_g \\
			0 & 1 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3 m_2) & S_g \\
			1 & 0 & 0 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3^2) & S_g \\
			0 & 0 & 1 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_2 m_3) & S_g \\
			0 & 0 & 1 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_3 m_1) & S_g \\
			0 & 0 & 1 & \ln(\rho) & \ln(m_1 m_2) & S_g \\
		\end{pmatrix} \\ & \begin{pmatrix}
			\ln(\lambda^{*}) \\
			\ln(\lambda_0') \\
			\ln(\mu_0) \\
			k \\
			l \\
			\ln(\beta_{S_g})\\
		\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}
			\epsilon_{1} \\
			\epsilon_{2} \\
			\epsilon_{3} \\
			\epsilon_{4} \\
			\epsilon_{5} \\
			\epsilon_{6} \\
			\epsilon_{7} \\
			\epsilon_{8} \\
			\epsilon_{9} \\
			\epsilon_{10} \\
			\epsilon_{11} \\
			\epsilon_{12} \\
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $S_g$ is coded using a summation constrain \cite{Fox2016}, meaning, $S_g = -1$ for the healthy group and $S_g = 1$ for the OI group. This model is adapted into a linear mixed-effect model to analyze the relation between tBMD and BV/TV and the effect of the group.

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\text{tBMD} = \begin{pmatrix}
			1 & \rho & S_g \\
		\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
			\beta_1 \\
			\beta_2 \\
			\beta_3 \\
		\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}
			1 & 1 \\
		\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
			\delta_1 \\
			\delta_2 \\
		\end{pmatrix} + \epsilon
	\end{split}
	\label{EqA14}
\end{equation}

Where $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$ represent the intercept and the slope for each different individual respectively. To test the hypothesis of no interaction between the BV/TV and the group, i.e. the group has no significant influence on the tBMD versus BV/TV slope, the previous model was modified to add the interaction regressor.

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\text{tBMD} = \begin{pmatrix}
			1 & \rho & S_g & \rho S_g\\
		\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
			\beta_1 \\
			\beta_2 \\
			\beta_3 \\
			\beta_4 \\
		\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}
			1 & 1 \\
		\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
			\delta_1 \\
			\delta_2 \\
		\end{pmatrix} + \epsilon
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
