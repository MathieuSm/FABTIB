abstract = {he aim of this chapter is to review different approaches that have been proposed to compute fabric tensors with emphasis on trabecular bone research. Fabric tensors aim at modeling through tensors both anisotropy and orientation of a material with respect to another one. Fabric tensors are widely used in fields such as trabecular bone research, mechanics of materials and geology. These tensors can be seen as semi-global measurements since they are computed in relatively large neighborhoods, which are assumed quasi-homogeneous. Many methods have been proposed to compute fabric tensors. We propose to classify fabric tensors into two categories: mechanics-based and morphology-based. The former computes fabric tensors from mechanical simulations, while the latter computes them by analyzing the morphology of the materials. In addition to pointing out advantages and drawbacks for each method, current trends and challenges in this field are also summarized.},
